## Description

>A useful ReadMe is essential for helping someone quickly understand and employ your project.

This project can be ran in the command line.  Once that is done, you will be prompted for information that should be contained in a typical ReadMe.  To help personalize the ReadMe, there is an axios call that uses your github username to pull your email and profile picture from GitHub's api.

This application is for anyone interested in quickly generating a ReadMe.
